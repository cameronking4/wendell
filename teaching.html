                           Observing life-long educators bring hope and joy to K-12 learning, and teaching youth from gang intervention projects to Yale College and Harvard College, has taught me that passionate and resilient teachers are game changers. When these educators display empathy—the mortar that binds learners, creates commonality, and delights in collective success—even the uninterested student can undergo a radical transformation. 
							</p><p> This ethos undergirds my pedagogical approach to studying and teaching the history of African descendants and marginalized peoples in the Americas.

						As a historian, I am committed to the advancement of critical analysis and writing. I teach my students to understand and appreciate that critical thinking and writing is a bedrock of a functional, healthy, liberal democracy. These skills, moreover, are necessary for independent, life-long learning. I am eager to teach and help cultivate a new crop of humanists who think critically, write effectively, and engage civil society responsibly.

					<p>In Fall 2018, I will teach “Binding Ties: African North Americans and Citizenship, 1775-Present” in the

I have served as a Teaching Fellow for the writing-intensive lecture “The Civil War and Reconstruction Era,”  facilitating two reading discussions and providing detailed feedback on student writing and performance. From 2014 to 2018, I guest lectured for the Yale College course “Quebec and Canada, 1791 to Present,” for which I reviewed select research papers.

                            <q class="testimonial-quote">Wendell is an excellent teaching fellow. Although he said that he had not originally planned on teaching a discussion section, I am very glad that he did. He presented incisive arguments in section about race and civil society. His spoken comments probed me to think more deeply about race in the United States today, and his written comments helped me refine my writing. I see the value of having everyone give their “visceral reactions” at the start of each section--it gets everyone to participate and allows us to gauge the mood of the class. However, they tend to take a large part of section. To quicken the pace and ensure that we have enough time in section to pursue other discussions, I would encourage Wendell to enforce time-limits for people’s comments.

                            <q class="testimonial-quote">This was 100% my favourite seminar. Wendell was so prepared and knew exactly what he wanted us to get out of it. He’s an amazing amazing teacher who is so good at making sure everyone feels that their input is valuable. He makes sure that everyone is thinking critically and raises very good questions that have been prepared beforehand. He’s very open-minded and willing to look at the problems from different perspectives, and creates a very positive and inviting learning environment. I also love his style of teaching because he does not have powerpoints, which could be dry, but unlike some of the other instructors I’ve had, he still is very prepared and informs us on many issues without lecturing us. I really like how he starts off by asking everyone what they thought from the reading, to set up a good platform for discussion and to hear from everybody. Wendell is definitely my favourite instructor and this was my favourite seminar.</q>

I am very interested in this topic, and Wendell’s knowledge of this matter and his personal background all makes this seminar a wonderful one. There is only one thing I want to point out. At the very end, Wendell shared with us some of his not so pleasant experiences. I like that but after this he unintentionally ended the seminar in a low mood. I was thinking if he could at the very end say a sentence or two to encourage us and drag the discussion back, it would have been a perfect ending and I think everyone would have clapped. But I still want to emphasize I llike his seminars very much.</q>
